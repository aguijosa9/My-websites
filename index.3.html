   <strong> I then read a book </strong>
    after a long while of being in a reading slump and finished it in a day! I didnt do much until thursday around 1:AM where my family and I left on a 
   <strong>roadtrip to New Jersey</strong> 
     to visit my family.
     It took about 14 hours but we had finally made it there around 4; 30 pm.
    On saturday, 
   <strong> We took a train to New york</strong>
     and spent our whole day walking around and visiting all the cool spots there.
    It was very cold so I wasnt able to enjoy it too much.</p>
