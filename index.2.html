<h1>The origins of chrsitmas</h1>
<h2>Andrea Guijosa</h2>
<h3>Christmas originates from <em>early Christian efforts</em> to place <b>Jesus</b> birth celebration on December 25th, co-opting existing <em>Roman winter festivals</em> like Saturnalia (feasting, gifts) and pagan traditions like evergreen decorations (Yule, Sol Invictus) for the winter solstice, eventually blending pagan customs with <b>Christian</b> observance to create a unified holiday, solidifying modern traditions like Christmas trees</h3>

<h3>On Christmas, believers attended church then celebrated raucously in a drunken, carnival-like atmosphere similar to today’s <em>Mardi Gras</em>. Each year, a beggar or student would be crowned the “lord of misrule,” and eager celebrants played the part of his subjects. The poor would go to the houses of the rich and demand their best food and drink. If owners failed to comply, their visitors would most likely terrorize them with mischief. <b>Christmas</b> became the time of year when the upper classes could repay their real or imagined “debt” to society by entertaining less fortunate citizens.</h4>
